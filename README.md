# Hello_Github
Thanks for your attention. It is only a test document.
I am new to Github, but I am not a new programmer.
I have been working in quantitative finance industries, and I will share my individual developed backtesting system, econometric model, PCA structure, modeling method, machine learning algorithm and quantitative strategies in probably a week (today is 26/01/2023). 
Thanks for your attention!
